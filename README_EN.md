## About

MarkNote is a native macOS floating note app with WYSIWYG Markdown editing, AI-assisted writing, and automatic iCloud sync. Inspired by [Antinote](https://antinote.io/) — built to go further with deeper AI integration. Many thanks to the Antinote team!

> This project was developed entirely via vibe coding.

## Design Philosophy

- **Summon & Dismiss** — Global shortcut to show/hide instantly, never in your way
- **What You See Is What You Get** — Live Markdown rendering, no preview toggle needed
- **Less Is More** — Minimal UI that stays out of the way of your thoughts

├── metadata.json       # Note index
├── note_<uuid>.md      # Note content
└── ...
```
